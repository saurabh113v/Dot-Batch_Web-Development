  <h1>What is Unit in CSS?</h1>
  <p>In CSS, a unit is a measurement used to define the size, length, or spacing of elements on a web page. Units help specify dimensions such as width, height, margin, padding, font-size, and more.</p>
  <h2>Commonly Used CSS Units</h2>  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pixels (px):</strong> A fixed unit representing a single dot on the screen. Commonly used for precise control over element dimensions.</li>
    <li><strong>Percentages (%):</strong> A relative unit that defines size as a percentage of the parent element's size. Useful for responsive designs.</li>
    <li><strong>Em (em):</strong> A relative unit based on the font-size of the parent element. 1em equals the current font-size, making it useful for scalable typography.</li>
    <li><strong>Rem (rem):</strong> Similar to em, but relative to the root element's font-size. This provides consistency across different elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewport Width (vw) and Viewport Height (vh):</strong> Relative units based on the size of the viewport. 1vw is 1% of the viewport's width, and 1vh is 1% of its height.</li>
    <li><strong>Centimeters (cm), Millimeters (mm), Inches (in):</strong> Absolute units used for print stylesheets or when physical dimensions are required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Difference Between 1% and 1vw ?</h3>
  <p>1% is relative to the parent element's size, while 1vw is relative to the viewport's width. For example, if a parent element is 500px wide, 1% of that would be 5px. However, if the viewport is 1000px wide, 1vw would be 10px.</p>

  
  <h2>Choosing the Right Unit</h2>
  <p>The choice of unit depends on the design requirements and the context in which it is used. For example, pixels are great for fixed layouts, while percentages and em/rem units are better  for responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
  <p>Understanding and using the appropriate CSS units is essential for creating visually appealing and functional web pages.</p>
