  <h1>what is css?</h1>
  <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It allows developers to separate content from design, enabling greater flexibility and control over the layout and appearance of web pages.</p> 
  
  <h2>Selector in css?</h2>
  <p>In CSS, a selector is a pattern used to select the HTML elements you want to style. Selectors can target elements based on their name, class, ID, attributes, and more. There are several types of selectors in CSS, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Element Selector: Selects all elements of a given type (e.g., p, h1).</li>
    <li>Class Selector: Selects elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., .classname).</li>
    <li>ID Selector: Selects a single element with a specific ID attribute (e.g., #idname).</li>
    <li>Attribute Selector: Selects elements based on the presence or value of an attribute (e.g., [type="text"]).</li>
    <li>Pseudo-class Selector: Selects elements based on their state (e.g., :hover, :first-child).</li>
  </ul> 


  <h2>Different types of css?</h2>
  <p>There are three main types of CSS:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline CSS: Styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the "style" attribute.</li>
    <li>Internal CSS: Styles are defined wit
    <li>External CSS: Styles are defined in an external stylesheet file (with a .css extension) and linked to the HTML document using a <link> tag.</li>
  </ul>
