  <h1>CSS Position Properties</h1>
  <p>CSS position properties are used to control the layout and positioning of HTML elements on a web page. These properties allow you to specify how elements are positioned in relation to their containing elements  or the viewport.</p>  
  <h2>Common CSS Position Properties</h2>
  <ul>    
    <li><strong>Static:</strong> This is the default positioning for all HTML elements. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.</li>     
    <li><   strong>Relative:</strong> Elements are positioned relative to their normal position. You can use the <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code> properties to adjust their position.</li>
    <li><strong>Absolute:</strong> Elements are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor    (or the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor exists). They are removed from the normal document flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Elements are positioned relative to the viewport and remain in the same position even when the page is scrolled.</li>
    <li><strong>Sticky:</strong> Elements are positioned based on the user's scroll position. They toggle between relative and fixed positioning depending on the scroll position.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Example of CSS Position Properties</h2>
